# Fruits into Baskets (medium)
#
# You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit
# trees. You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as
# possible to be placed in the given baskets.
#
# You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit
# tree. The farm has following restrictions:
#
# - Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a
#   basket can hold.
# - You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
# - You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will
#   stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
#
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
