# Cyclic Sort (easy)
#
# We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned
# a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. This means
# that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with
# sequence number 4.
#
# Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in
# O(n) and without using any extra space. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are
# passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is
# actually an object.

def sort( arr ):
   # index : 0 1 2 3 4
   # array : 3 1 5 4 2
   # 0       5 1 3 4 2
   #         2 1 3 4 5
   #         1 2 3 4 5
